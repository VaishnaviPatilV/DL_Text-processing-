# DL_Text-processing-
 Text Preprocessing in Python (NLP)
 
# Overview

This project focuses on Text Preprocessing, which is a very important step in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The notebook demonstrates how raw text data is cleaned and prepared before applying machine learning or deep learning models.
Text preprocessing helps improve model accuracy, performance, and understanding of text data.

 # Concepts Covered

The notebook includes the following text preprocessing steps:

Converting text to lowercase
Removing punctuation
Removing numbers
Tokenization
Removing stopwords
Stemming
Lemmatization
Handling extra spaces
Cleaning noisy and unstructured text

 # Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used:
pandas
numpy
nltk

re (Regular Expressions)

string
